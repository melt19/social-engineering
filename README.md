## Melissa Turner's Social Engineering Projects

In this GitHub repository are some of my projects I have completed surrounding the topic of social engineering. 

**1. Social Engineering Presentation**
This presentation focuses on the defensive aspect of social engineering as a whole. Looks into why social engineering is such a problem and steps to prevent it. 

**2. Criminological Take on Social Engineering**
A (fake) pitch to the FBI about the 2016 Spear Phishing Incident in America. (Some of the less important slides had to be culled in order to upload)

**3. Cyber Buddy**
I went to [Hacker Exchange][https://hacker.exchange/] and brought the idea of a personal cyber assistant to workshop and pitch to angel investors. Cyber buddy is intended to help detect social engineering eg. phishing and have user friendly, non-technical warnings to guide the user in the right direction and keep them aware. 


I appreciate you taking the time to look through my previous work and I am super excited to keep working on social engineering topics this year.
